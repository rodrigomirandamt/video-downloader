Here are a few relatively light‐lift paths to get a truly native‐macOS look:

1. **BeeWare Toga**

   * A Python toolkit that wraps native widgets on each platform.
   * You write pure Python, but on macOS it uses Cocoa controls under the hood.
   * Package with Briefcase into a standard `.app`.

2. **PySide6 (Qt6) with macOS styling**

   * Qt6’s QMacStyle gives you native appearance for buttons, menus, dialogs.
   * You can still code in Python, but you get the San Francisco font, unified toolbar, dark-mode support.
   * Bundle via PyInstaller or Qt’s macdeployqt.

3. **SwiftUI “front end” + Python backend**

   * Rewrite just the UI in SwiftUI (Xcode), calling your existing Python logic via [PythonKit](https://github.com/pvieito/PythonKit).
   * Gives you full SwiftUI power (sidebar, native date pickers, text fields) with minimal business-logic rewrite.

4. **Flutter Desktop**

   * Single codebase for macOS, Windows, Linux.
   * macOS build uses native menus and titlebar integration.
   * Dart is easy to pick up if you already know Python.

5. **Electron with macOS HIG**

   * If you don’t mind JS, Electron can be themed to match Apple’s guidelines.
   * Lots of existing templates (e.g. macOS menubar apps).

**Plus, polish regardless of framework:**

* Use SF Pro as your font.
* Adopt the system menu bar (no custom “File/Help” in-window).
* Support Dark Mode and accent‐color tinting.
* Add a proper app icon and Assets.car.
* Code-sign and notarize so it installs like a “real” app.

Which of these sounds closest to your comfort zone?
