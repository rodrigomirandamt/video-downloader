Gotta keep them bones nice and strong. *sips milky* Ahh. So what's your name, little guy? Oh uh, uh it's Kevin.

*sniffles* Nice to meet you, Kevin. But... You look pretty down. Is something the matter, friend?

Oh uh well it's just... *Sigh* I-it's M'lady... She's been captured again by this Orc... H-he's kind of my n-nemesis.

*sniffles* I'm sorry to hear that. This Orc seems like a pretty bad guy. H-h-he is! He's He's always attacking caravans and raiding villages and capturing M'lady...

Sounds like he needs to be punished. W-well I would but... I have an oath... A-against murder!

I respect that. *sippies milk* Ahh *smack smack* But the best sort of punishment... DOESN'T REQUIRE KILLING AT ALL. *Kevin begins to unlock his third eye* Lets go pay this Orc a little visit.
